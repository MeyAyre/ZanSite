              <h2>THE PLUSH</h2>
                <br>
              <p>
                My plushes are made of “minky”, a luxuriously soft and durable fabric best known for its use in baby blankets.
                They are primarily sewn with a machine, but some pieces may be hand-sewn making them unsuitable for children’s
                toys and rough play. SPECIFY if you want it sturdy, and I will do my best! Details are a variety of things like
                minky, fleece, felt, iron-on patch fabric (painted), and machine embroidery, that are sewn on or attached with
                fusible fabric webbing. They are stuffed with “Cluster Fluff” Polyfil non-clumping pillow stuffing.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>THE PATTERN</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                I make most of the patterns myself, and the ones I purchase are used with proper permissions. (For example,
                the Sushi are made from patterns by CholyKnight who allows selling of finished plushes.) I am willing to
                make any of these in any combination (as they are quite flexible!), or adventure to make something new. If
                you do have a pattern you want made, and proper permission from the creator, I’m perfectly happy to make it
                for you! At the moment none of my own patterns are available.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>THE TIME</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                The time it takes to make a plush can range from 3 days to 3 months depending on my schedule and the
                complexity of the plush. I work hard to make them as perfect as possible, and that takes time, so please
                do not rush me! Feel free to check in on the status within reason, and if you need it by a specific date,
                tell me as soon as possible!
                <br><br>
                If I have made it before/have the pattern, the time will definitely be shorter! If I do not have the
                pattern/haven’t made it before I can only give you an estimate because trial and error is time-consuming!
                If I have more than one commission running, then the time starts after the previous one has been finished.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>THE PRICE</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                I charge $10 an hour for my work, and a materials fee depending on size, shipping not included
                (the size/weight changes the price, as well as where it is shipped to. Packages inside the US are tracked,
                and if you would like insurance that cost will be added. ). Contact me for a quote on the price.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>THE PAYMENT</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                I can take payment through Etsy or Paypal! If the Plushie costs under $100 the payment must be sent before
                I start and is non-refundable. Anything costing more than $100 will require a nonrefundable 50% down
                payment, with balance due upon completion and before shipping. I won’t do refunds unless there is a
                considerable reason, and if there is a problem, I will do my best to fix it!
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>WHAT I WON’T DO</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Please ask what you have in mind, but I will not make anything super complex. I will also not make gore
                or anything NSFW.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>THE TECHNICAL DETAILS</h2>
              <br>
              <p>
                Please be specific with what you are looking for so I can do my best to satisfy your request.
                I live in a smoke-free environment, but not pet-free. I have a dog and pet rats, and while they are not
                allowed near the fabric, if you have an allergy let me know.<br><br>
                Please feel free to post pictures of your plush, just credit it me the first time you do!
                The commissions are first come first serve, so if you are interested let me know so I can put you on the
                 list! Also do not be afraid to ask any questions you still have.
              </p>
