            <h2>WIMPOD COMMISSIONS</h2>
            <p>
              Wimpod commission option! Please read the full description, along with my commissions
              <a href="commissions.html">page before inquiring. </a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            My Wimpod plushes are made entirely from minky, with machine-embroidered eyes and stiff material supporting
             the antennae. They are lightly stuffed with polyfil enough so that they are still squishy. Their plates and
             tails are heat-fused, making them slightly stiffer. Their eyes,  whiskers and antennae are attached by hand,
              and while being sturdy enough to withstand being carried and shoved around a convention for 3 days, they may
              come apart if pulled on excessively. The plates might turn out a little askew (as they have on mine), but I
               will do my best to prevent this.
             </p>

             <br>
             <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> the shiny wimpod’s upper eyelids are the wrong color on mine and will be white on yours.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Also Note:</strong> The faces on all three are a little different as I experimented, but I will continue with the rounder
               sewn one on “Lavender Mint” If you would like to personalize your Pokemon (with an item or accessory) I would
                be delighted to work with you! Give me your ideas! The price will depend on the object and simplicity, but
                shouldn’t be too much. It will also be made out of minky unless requested otherwise. (Ex. Another fabric,
                another material etc)
              </p>
            <p>
            <br>
            They are around 26″ which is larger than their pokedex size, but they can be resized down if requested!
            <br><br>
            These Wimpods are $200 apiece + any extras + shipping.
